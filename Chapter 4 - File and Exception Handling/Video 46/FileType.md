# Java Built-in Packages

In Java, a group of related classes is organized together in a package, similar to how files are organized in directories. In Java, you can use either built-in packages or define your own packages.

## `java.lang`
- Contains classes for primitive types, strings, threads, exceptions, and math functions.

## `java.io`
- Includes stream classes for Input/Output operations.

## `java.awt`
- Provides classes for implementing Graphical User Interface (GUI) components, such as menus, windows, buttons, etc.

## `java.util`
- Contains classes for handling utility operations, including dates, calendars, vectors, hash tables, etc.

## `java.net`
- Includes classes for networking operations.

## `java.applet`
- Consists of classes for creating and implementing applets.

In Java, packages play a crucial role in organizing and managing the classes, making it easier to structure and maintain large-scale projects.
