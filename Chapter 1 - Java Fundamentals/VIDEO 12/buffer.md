**StringBuffer in Java:**

`StringBuffer` is a class in Java that represents a mutable sequence of characters. Unlike the `String` class, which is immutable (cannot be changed), `StringBuffer` allows modifications to its content. It is designed for situations where you need to perform multiple modifications to a character sequence efficiently.

**Key Features:**
1. **Mutable:** Content of a `StringBuffer` object can be changed without creating a new object.
2. **Synchronized:** `StringBuffer` is thread-safe, allowing safe concurrent access and modification by multiple threads.
3. **Modification Methods:** Provides methods like `append()`, `insert()`, `delete()`, and `replace()` for modifying content.
4. **Capacity Management:** Dynamically resizes its buffer to accommodate changes in the length of character sequences.

**Example Usage:**

```java
public class StringBufferExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating a StringBuffer
        StringBuffer stringBuffer = new StringBuffer("Hello");

        // Appending more characters
        stringBuffer.append(" World!");

        // Inserting characters at a specific position
        stringBuffer.insert(6, " Java");

        // Deleting characters
        stringBuffer.delete(5, 11);

        // Displaying the final result
        System.out.println(stringBuffer.toString());
    }
}
```

In this example:
- A `StringBuffer` is created with the initial content "Hello".
- Additional characters are appended using `append()`.
- Characters are inserted at a specific position using `insert()`.
- Some characters are deleted using `delete()`.
- The final modified result is then displayed.

The output of this program will be: `HJavao!`
