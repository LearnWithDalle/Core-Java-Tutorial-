# James Gosling - Father of Java Programming

Java is an Object-Oriented Programming language, allowing the organization of program code into logical units called objects. It enables the utilization of encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and more.

## Java Features
- **Simple:** Easy to learn and use.
- **Secure:** Provides a secure execution environment.
- **Portable:** Platform-independent code.
- **Object-oriented:** Utilizes encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism.
- **Robust:** Strong memory management, error checking.
- **Multithreaded:** Supports concurrent execution of multiple threads.
- **Architecture-neutral:** No implementation-dependent aspects.
- **Interpreted:** Bytecode interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- **High Performance:** Optimized for performance.
- **Distributed:** Facilitates distributed computing.
- **Dynamic:** Supports dynamic memory allocation.

## Primitive Data Types
Java defines eight primitive types:
1. byte
2. short
3. int
4. long
5. char
6. float
7. double
8. Boolean

## Arrays in Java
- An array is a group of like-typed variables referred to by a common name.
- Arrays can have one or more dimensions.
- Types of arrays: 1D array, 2D array.

### 1D Array
- A one-dimensional array has only one subscript.

### 2D Array
- A matrix of rows and columns.

## Java Math Class
- Provides methods for math calculations:
  - `min()`
  - `max()`
  - `avg()`
  - `sin()`
  - `cos()`
  - `tan()`
  - `round()`
  - `ceil()`
  - `floor()`
  - `abs()`
  
## Scanner Class
- Part of the `java.util` package.
- Used for obtaining input of primitive types like int, double, etc., and strings.

## Package in Java
- A package is a collection of classes and interfaces.
