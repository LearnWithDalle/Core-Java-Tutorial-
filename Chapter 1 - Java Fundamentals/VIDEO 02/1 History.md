# Little History:

Java was developed at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle) in 1991, by a team of James Gosling, Patrick Naughton, Chris Wrath, Ed Frank, and Mike Sheridan as its members. The language was initially called Oak. It was later termed as Java. Java is a general-purpose, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language. James Gosling is called the father of Java Programming.

# Key Points:

- ### **Simple:** 
    Java is a simple language. There are various concepts that make Java a simple language. Java is designed to be easy to learn. Programs in Java are easy to write and debug because Java does not use pointers, preprocessor header files, operator overloading, etc.

- ### **Secure:** 
    Java is aimed to be used in networked or distributed environments. Java does not allocate direct pointers to memory, making it impossible to accidentally reference memory that belongs to other programs.

- ### **Portable:** 
    Being architectural-neutral and having no implementation-dependent aspects of the specification makes Java portable. Java code is portable. It was an important design goal of Java that it be portable so that as new architectures (due to hardware, operating system, or both) are developed, the Java environment could be ported to them.

- ### **Object-oriented:** 
    Java is a truly object-oriented language. Almost everything in Java is an object. Java has a wide variety of classes organized in various packages. We can use them in our programs while implementing inheritance. The object model in Java is simple and easy to extend.

- ### **Robust:** 
    Java is a robust language because it provides many safeguards to ensure reliable code. Java does not allow pointers, which avoids security problems. There is no concept of a reference variable, eliminating the possibility of overwriting memory and corrupting data. Automatic garbage collection eliminates memory leaks.

- ### **Multithreaded:** 
    Java was designed to meet the real-world requirement of creating interactive, networked programs. To accomplish this, Java supports multithreaded programming, allowing you to write programs that do many things simultaneously. The Java runtime system comes with an elegant yet sophisticated solution for multi-process synchronization that enables you to construct smoothly running interactive systems.

- ### **Architecture-neutral:** 
    A central issue for the Java designers was that of code longevity and portability. One of the main problems facing programmers is that no guarantee exists that if you write a program today, it will run tomorrow even on the same machine. Operating system upgrades, processor upgrades, and changes in core system resources can all combine to make a program malfunction. Their goal was "write once; run anywhere, anytime, forever." To a great extent, this goal was accomplished.

- ### **Interpreted:** 
    As described earlier, Java enables the creation of cross-platform programs by compiling into an intermediate representation called Java bytecode. Most previous attempts at cross-platform solutions have done so at the expense of performance.

- ### **High Performance:** 
    The Java bytecode was carefully designed so that it would be easy to translate directly into native machine code for very high performance by using a just-in-time compiler.

- ### **Distributed:**
     Java facilitates the building of distributed applications by a collection of classes for use in networked applications. Java is designed for the distributed environment of the Internet.

- ### **Dynamic:** 
    Java language is capable of dynamically linking in new class libraries, methods, and objects. Because Java is interpreted, Java is an extremely dynamic language. At runtime, the Java environment can extend itself by linking in classes that may be located on remote servers on a network, for example, the Internet.
