# Epoch has multiple definitions: 

## In general
An epoch is a time or event that marks the start of a new period or development. It can also refer to a memorable event or date, or an extended period of time with a distinctive development or series of events. For example, the birth of Christ is an epoch that marked the beginning of the Christian era.
## In chronology
An epoch is a reference point in time used to start a calendar era. For example, Windows NT systems measure time as the number of 100-nanosecond intervals that have passed since January 1, 1601, 00:00:00 UTC.
## In machine learning
An epoch is the number of times a dataset is passed through an algorithm as part of the training process. Epochs are a key part of training neural networks and other machine learning algorithms. The right number of epochs is important for the model to learn effectively.
