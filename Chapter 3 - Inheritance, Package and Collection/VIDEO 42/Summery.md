## Summary

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** allows you to create a new class by inheriting from an existing class. Inheritance is a significant and essential feature of OOP because it:
  - Supports hierarchical classifications,
  - Supports class reusability, and
  - Defines specialization.

- **OOP** typically allows classes to inherit state and behavior from other classes.

- A **subclass** inherits available data fields and methods from its superclass, but superclass constructors are not inherited in the subclass. They can only be invoked by subclass constructors using the 'super' keyword.

- **'super'** keyword is used to refer to the immediate superclass by a subclass.

- **'final'** is a keyword in the Java Language. The final keyword is used as a modifier in various contexts of variable declaration, methods, and classes, indicating that they cannot be changed.

- If we want a class not to be subclassed by any other class, we declare it final. In Java, if we define a class using the final keyword, such a class is called a 'final class.'

- An **Abstract class** is a superclass that defines only a common form that will be shared by all its subclasses.

- An **Interface** is a blueprint for a class. It contains static constants and abstract methods only. An interface is a way to specify what a class must do, without specifying how it does it.

- **Method overriding** occurs when the same method as declared in the parent class exists in a subclass (child class).

- **Polymorphism** is a concept in Java that allows us to perform a single action in different ways. Polymorphism is derived from two Greek words: "poly" meaning many and "morphs" meaning forms. Polymorphism means many forms.
